            Installation source for jenkins-job-bulider.  Supported options:

            distro (only supported on Ubuntu 13.10 and later)
            git://github.com/openstack-infra/jenkins-job-builder.git or similar

            Alternatively, you may run the 'make sourcedeps' target of the
            Makefile to package required assets into the charm prior to deploying,
            for environments where network access is restricted.  Any bundled
            package will override any value set here.
    config-repo:
        type: string
        description: |
            Revision control repository url containing collection of yaml files
            containing jenkins-job-builder configs. This may also be packaged
            locally prior to deploying by running 'make configrepo' target of
            the Makefile to pull from a specified repository.  Again, any
            bundled assets will override any setting set here.  The contents of
            this repository (or anything packaged with the charm) will end up
            installed in/etc/jenkins-job-builder/job-configs/ on the service
            unit.

            Launchpad git branches should use the full URL; the 'lp:' prefix
            will not be expanded.
    config-repo-revision:
        type: string
        default: "trunk"
        description: |

            "trunk", and is updated on during every config-changed hook.

        description: |
            If configured to run from trunk of a remote repository, you may
            optionally have the charm install a cronjob that will periodically
            pull trunk and update Jenkins.
    update-frequency:
        type: string
        default: ''
        description: |
            If schedule-updates is True, update-frequency sets the schedule on
