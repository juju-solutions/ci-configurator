            Installation source for jenkins-job-bulider.  Supported options:

            distro (only supported on Ubuntu 13.10 and later)
            git://github.com/openstack-infra/jenkins-job-builder.git or similar

            Alternatively, you may run the 'make sourcedeps' target of the
            Makefile to package required assets into the charm prior to deploying,
            for environments where network access is restricted.  Any bundled
            package will override any value set here.
    config-repo:

        description: |
            Bzr repository url containing collection of yaml files containing
            jenkins-job-builder configs. This may also be packaged locally
            prior to deploying by running 'make configrepo' target of the
            Makefile to pull from a specified repository.  Again, any bundled
            assets will override any setting set here.  The contents of this
            repository (or anything packaged with the charm) will end up
            installed in/etc/jenkins-job-builder/job-configs/ on the service
            unit.

    schedule-updates:
        type: boolean
        default: false
        description: |
            If configured to run from trunk of a remote repository, you may
            optionally have the charm install a cronjob that will periodically
            pull trunk and update Jenkins.
    update-frequency:
        type: string
        default: ''
        description: |
